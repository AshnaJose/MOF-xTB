Machine learning tools and notebooks for analyzing MOF properties.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `data_analysis.ipynb` 
  Exploratory Data Analysis notebook to:
  - Inspect and visualize the MOF dataset
  - Compare xTB band gaps to reference DFT data
  - Prepare data for ML 

- `visualisation.ipynb` â€“ produces key visual outputs such as:
  - Feature distribution histograms  
  - t-SNE plots for the dataset
 
- `training_and_testing.ipynb`
  - Load feature and target datasets (including Î”-learning targets)
  - Split data into training and testing sets 
  - Train a **XGBoost Regressor** on the **Î”-learning** target, as well as direct target.  
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE and RÂ².  
  - Visualize predicted vs. actual Î”-learning values with parity plots.
