# MOF-xTB

# Overview

This repository provides a Python-based workflow for running **GFN1-xTB** electronic structure calculations on a batch of **MOF (Metalâ€“Organic Framework)** structures using **DFTB+**. It automates structure processing, DFTB+ input generation, band structure calculation, density of states (DOS), and band gap extraction. ML Models for accurate band gap prediction are then trained using the generated data.

 # MOF-xTB Workflow

A Python-based automated workflow for analyzing the electronic structure of Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) using GFN1-xTB with DFTB+ is provided.

This code:
- Parses CIF files and converts them to `.gen` format for DFTB+
- Runs GFN1-xTB calculations (via DFTB+)
- Post-processes to extract the bandgap and density of states (DOS)

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Batch processing** of `.cif` structure files
- Automatic **generation of DFTB+ input files**
- Calculations using **GFN1-xTB method**
- **Density of States (DOS)** calculation using `dp_dos` and bandgap estimation 

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.7
- [DFTB+](https://www.dftbplus.org/)
- Python packages:
  - `ase`
  - `pymatgen`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `pandas`
